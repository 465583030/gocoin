===============================================================================
The implementation of the native ECDSA speedup package btc/newec
is based on the code created by Pieter Wuille. The original code
has been significantly rewritten while it was being ported from C
to Go, but the author of the original implementation had obvious
contribution into the package's code, therefore please read this:

Few parts of the source code (e.g. "btc/target.go") were taken
