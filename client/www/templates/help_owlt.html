<h2>Offline Wallet</h2>

Run <span class="cod">wallet -h</span> to see all available command line switches.<br>
<br>

<h3>Setup your seed</h3>
Wallet is deterministic and the only thing you need to setup it, is the seed password.<br>
As long as you remember the password, you do not need to backup the wallet ever.<br>
You can either enter this password each time when running the wallet, or you can store it in a file called
<span class="cod">.secret</span> and never be asked to enter it again.<br>
<br>

<h3>Export public addresses</h3>
After you setup your wallet in a secured environment, you should export its public addresses.
In order to to this, just run <span class="cod">wallet -l</span> and your wallet's public
addresses will be written to <span class="cod">wallet.txt</span>.<br>
Now you can take this text file safely to your client's PC and place it in the folder where it
looks for wallet files (i.e. <span class="cod">~/.bitcoin/gocoin/btcnet/wallet/</span>).<br>
<br>

<h3>Multiple wallets</h3>
It is advised to rename the wallet.txt to DEFAULT - this will be the wallet that is always
loaded at startup. Additionally in the gocoin's wallet folder you can have other text files (representing wallets), that contain different sets of bitcoin addresses. This will allow you to quickly switch between the wallets, using WebUI's Wallets tab. The tab allows you to also edit your wallets, as well as to create a new ones.<br>
<br>

<h3>Security precautions</h3>
Make sure that the disk with <span class="cod">.secret</span> file is encrypted.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that <span class="cod">.secret</span> should not contain any non-printable
characters, nor new line characters, because they count while calculating the seed.<br>
Since you do not see such characters on screen, you may have problems re-creating the
same file after you would loose it.<br>
<br>
Also note that the seed password is the key to your entire wallet, so make sure that it is
resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.<br>
<br>

<h3>Importing other private keys</h3>
You can import keys from your existing bitcoin wallet, as well as keys generated by other
tools (all kind of key/address generators).<br>
<br>
The key that you want to import must be in base58 encoded format, which looks somehow like
<span class="cod">5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS</span>.
To export a private key from the official bitcoin wallet use dumprivkey RPC command.
To import such a key into your Gocoin wallet, just store the base58 encoded value in a text
file named <span class="cod">.others</span> (each key must be in a separate line).
You can also place a key's label in each line, after a space.<br>
<br>
The imported keys will extend the key pool of the deterministic ones (that come from
your password-seed). After Importing each new key, you should redo
<span class="cod">wallet -l</span> to get an updated <span class="cod">wallet.txt</span>
for your client.<br>
