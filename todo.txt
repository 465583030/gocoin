* Do something with the fixed 129.132.230.0/24
* Improve the database folder locking in Linux
* Implement a secured password input method for the wallet app (for Windows with no mingw)
* Implement a cache for address balances so switching between wallets would be quick
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
