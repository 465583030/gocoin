Client:
* Fix: baning of incomming peers seems to not ignore the port number
* Bug: "client/usif/webui/wallets.go" can crash with "index out of range" at "wallet.MyWallet.Addrs[i].Extra.Label"
* Seems that a single stealth metadata index can have more than one ephemkey (find out how to handle it)
* Do not list unmatured coinbase outputs in the balance
* Add some support for showing text messages attached to incomming coins (after OP_RETURN)
* Improve the database folder locking in Linux
* Implement "mempool"

Tools:
* txaddsig - make it to work with multisig

Wallet:
* Write some automated tests
* Add Type-4 as HD Wallet

Downloader:
* Check a possibility to speed it up by disabling the sync
* Avoid re-building of UTXO-db while using "-b"
* Make it to work with gocoin.cfg file

Core lib:
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
* Address the occasional "incorrect proof of work" problem in testnet:
	(it's probably 'Extra checks to prevent "fill up memory by spamming with bogus blocks"' that screws it up)
