Lib:
* Implement BIP9
* Seen "FindPathTo: Unknown path to block" from NewChainExt/ParseTillBlock on init, after soft exit. Undo helped.

Downloader:
* If only e.g. 2 blocks are left, it is fetching them from a single peer

Client:
* Make sure it does not need to "Undo block ##" after fist rejecting it with "Corrupt block received from"
	Corrupt block received from 91.106.149.46:8333 CheckBlock() : size limits failed high - RPC_Result:bad-blk-length
	Undo block 450529 000000000000000000cf208f521de0424677f7a87f2f278a1042f38d159565f5 976 KB
* Monitor: the main look got stuck in network.Tick() function after ~50 days of uptime
* Implement SegWit addresses handling and fetching balances from segwit addresses
* Show unconfirmed transactions (inside the mempool) if they have something to do with the current wallet
* Implement "Child Pays for Parent Merged" (mining feature)
* At slow connections it gets stuck (new blocks stop being downloaded). Go to standby and come back.
* StealthAddr: seems that a single metadata index can have more than one ephemkey (find out how to handle it)

Wallet:
* Implement sending coins to/from segwit addresses

 Probably not to do:
* Do not list unmatured coinbase outputs in the balance
* Implement "mempool" network command

Tools:
* txaddsig - make it to work with multisig

Wallet:
* Write some automated tests

Core lib:
* CheckTransactions to return descriptive errors (e.g. "bad-txns-vin-empty")
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
