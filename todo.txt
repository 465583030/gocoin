* Implement multisig in the wallet and 3... type addresses in the client
* Add support for relay=0 received from peers (do not send tx invs to them)
* Rejected transactions that have already been mined should not end up in "TransactionsRejected"
* Finish "chaindl" tool
* Add some an address book for MakeTx destination addresses
* Do something with the fixed 129.132.230.0/24
* Improve the database folder locking in Linux
* Implement a secured password input method for the wallet app (for Windows with no mingw)
* Implement a cache for address balances so switching between wallets would be quick
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* Try to improve initial chain download speed
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
