* Imlement a secured password input method for the wallet app
* Disconnect & ban nodes that do not send any of just a few data
* Implement a cache for address balances so switching between wallets would be quick
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* Try to improve initial chain download speed
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
* "signrawtransaction" for the wallet (so a user could compose the tx in an online node)
