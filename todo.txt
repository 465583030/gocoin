Lib:
* Implement BIP9
* Seen "FindPathTo: Unknown path to block" from NewChainExt/ParseTillBlock on init, after soft exit. Undo helped.

Downloader:
* If only e.g. 2 blocks are left, it is fetching them from a single peer

Client:
* Remove the functionality to reject transactions because of the "dust"
* Runs out of memory synchronizing chain after 4 weeks - just test it now with 4000+ blocks
* Show unconfirmed transactions (inside the mempool) if they have something to do with the current wallet
* Implement "Child Pays for Parent Merged" (mining feature)
* At slow connections it gets stuck (new blocks stop being downloaded). Go to standby and come back.
* StealthAddr: seems that a single metadata index can have more than one ephemkey (find out how to handle it)

 Probably not to do:
* Do not list unmatured coinbase outputs in the balance
* Implement "mempool" network command

Tools:
* txaddsig - make it to work with multisig

Wallet:
* Write some automated tests

Core lib:
* CheckTransactions to return descriptive errors (e.g. "bad-txns-vin-empty")
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
