Downloader:

Client:
* Implement RBF in the mempool - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1331275.msg13921601#msg13921601
* At slow connections it gets stuck (new blocks stop being downloaded). Go to standby and come back.
* StealthAddr: seems that a single metadata index can have more than one ephemkey (find out how to handle it)
* Add some support for showing text messages attached to incomming coins (after OP_RETURN)
* Improve the database folder locking in Linux

 Probably not to do:
* Do not list unmatured coinbase outputs in the balance
* Implement "mempool" network command

Tools:
* txaddsig - make it to work with multisig

Wallet:
* Write some automated tests

Core lib:
* Add checking timestamps (everywhere) against GetMedianTimePast()
* CheckTransactions to return descriptive errors (e.g. "bad-txns-vin-empty")
* Verify if we dont need to check for "sigoplimit" in one transaciton
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
