Lib:
* Implement BIP9
* Seen "FindPathTo: Unknown path to block" from NewChainExt/ParseTillBlock on init, after soft exit. Undo helped.
* Check implemetation against this: https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/a-bitcoin-transaction-that-takes-5-hours-to-verify/
* CheckTransactions to return descriptive errors (e.g. "bad-txns-vin-empty")
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()

Client:
* After downloading blockchain with "-v" it does not save UTXO.db
* Abort saving of UTXO.db before processing a new block
* Update client/wallet database after (not during) the block is commited to UTXO as it struggles on testnet after block 601024...)
* Monitor: the main loop got stuck in network.Tick() function after ~50 days of uptime (see TODO in tick.go)
* Orphaned blocks cause printing:
	BlockGetExt failed for 0000000000000000013503d24a8c9b8001f663a4d5ea9f06f9f38d58805723ae Block not in the index

* Make sure it does not need to "Undo block ##" after fist rejecting it with "Corrupt block received from"
	Corrupt block received from 91.106.149.46:8333 CheckBlock() : size limits failed high - RPC_Result:bad-blk-length
	Undo block 450529 000000000000000000cf208f521de0424677f7a87f2f278a1042f38d159565f5 976 KB
* Show unconfirmed transactions (inside the mempool) if they have something to do with the current wallet
* Implement "Child Pays for Parent Merged" (mining feature)
* At slow connections it gets stuck (new blocks stop being downloaded). Go to standby and come back.

Wallet:
* Implement "server mode", e.g. through TCP or serial connection
* Write some automated tests

Probably not to do:
* Do not list unmatured coinbase outputs in the balance
* Implement "mempool" network command

Tools:
* txaddsig - make it to work with multisig
