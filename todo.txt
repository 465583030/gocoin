Fix realtime address update when receiving a second outpyt for a stealth addrs
Allow to do multisig -> stealth spending

Client:
* Add better support for text messages inside transactions (after OP_RETURN)
* Improve the database folder locking in Linux
* Implement "mempool"

Wallet:
* Not brute force the nonce for stealth address prefix?
* Do not update changes to balance/unspent.txt if a signing was not complete

Downloader:
* Make it to work with gocoion.cfg file

Core lib:
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
