Downloader:
* After a lower block time outs, retry it instead of trying higher one
* AvgBLen is not calclated properly (it shoudl be over last N blocks, not since block #1)
* Check a possibility to speed it up by disabling the sync
* Avoid re-building of UTXO-db while using "-b"

Client:
* Check a potential (insuficcient) COINBASE_MATURITY before accepting a TX to the mempool
* Implement RBF in the mempool - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1331275.msg13921601#msg13921601
* At slow connections it gets stuck (new blocks stop being downloaded). Go to standby and come back.
* Remove confirned TXs from the rejected list
* Seems that a single stealth metadata index can have more than one ephemkey (find out how to handle it)
* Do not list unmatured coinbase outputs in the balance (???)
* Add some support for showing text messages attached to incomming coins (after OP_RETURN)
* Improve the database folder locking in Linux
* Implement "mempool" network command

Tools:
* txaddsig - make it to work with multisig

Wallet:
* Write some automated tests

Core lib:
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
* Address the occasional "incorrect proof of work" problem in testnet:
	(it's probably 'Extra checks to prevent "fill up memory by spamming with bogus blocks"' that screws it up)
