* Do something with the fixed 129.132.230.0/24
* Broadcast own transaction "slowly" (e.g. with 1 second delay for each new peer)
* Make fetchbalance.go to work with a proxy (for Tor)
* Improve the database folder locking in Linux
* Implement a secured password input method for the wallet app (for Windows with no mingw)
* Implement a cache for address balances so switching between wallets would be quick
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* Try to improve initial chain download speed
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
* "signrawtransaction" for the wallet (so a user could compose the tx in an online node)
