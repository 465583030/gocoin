Lib:
* Implement BIP9
* Seen "FindPathTo: Unknown path to block" from NewChainExt/ParseTillBlock on init, after soft exit. Undo helped.

Client:
* When CommitBlock() returns arror, discard all the headers that depend on it
* Implement "Child Pays for Parent Merged" (mining feature)
* Check how the "MoveToBlock cannot continue" solution works in reality
* At slow connections it gets stuck (new blocks stop being downloaded). Go to standby and come back.
* StealthAddr: seems that a single metadata index can have more than one ephemkey (find out how to handle it)
* Add some support for showing text messages attached to incomming coins (after OP_RETURN)

 Probably not to do:
* Do not list unmatured coinbase outputs in the balance
* Implement "mempool" network command

Tools:
* txaddsig - make it to work with multisig

Wallet:
* Write some automated tests

Core lib:
* Add checking timestamps (everywhere) against GetMedianTimePast()
* CheckTransactions to return descriptive errors (e.g. "bad-txns-vin-empty")
* Verify if we dont need to check for "sigoplimit" in one transaciton
* Try to make own (faster) implementation of sha256 and rimp160
* The best chain should be decided on the amount of hashing work, not the length - SetBestChain()
